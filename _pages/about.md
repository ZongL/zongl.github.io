I am a Software Engineer from China, now living in Beijing. I have a passion for coding and love to experiment with things. While I work for Didi, the opinions expressed on this blog are solely my own and do not reflect company policy in any way. Most of my recent work is only available within Didi, but see publications for what is public.

These days, I mostly write C and Python with a sprinkling of TypeScript for work. Over time I ended up with readability in 6.

I like share my thoughts on web, check out my post on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/zong-liang-6).
