I am a Software Engineer from China, now living in Beijing. I have a passion for coding and love to experiment with things. While I work for Didi, the opinions expressed on this blog are solely my own and do not reflect company policy in any way. 

These days, I mostly write C and Python with a sprinkling of TypeScript for work.
